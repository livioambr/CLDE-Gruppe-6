# Solution Summary: AWS Connection Issue

## Your Problem

You reported: "The server at 23.22.44.190 is taking too long to respond"

## Analysis

This is **NOT a code problem**. This is an **AWS configuration problem**.

The code is correct:
- ✅ Server binds to `0.0.0.0` (all network interfaces)
- ✅ Server listens on port 3000
- ✅ Environment variable support is in place
- ✅ Health check endpoint exists

## Most Likely Cause

**Your EC2 Security Group is NOT allowing incoming connections on port 3000.**

This is by far the most common issue in our experience.

## The Fix You Probably Need

1. Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Security Groups
2. Find your security group (e.g., `hangman-server-sg`)
3. Click "Inbound rules" → "Edit inbound rules"
4. Click "Add rule"
5. Set:
   - Type: Custom TCP
   - Port: 3000
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0
6. Click "Add rule" again
7. Set:
   - Type: Custom TCP
   - Port: 3000
   - Source: ::/0
8. Click "Save rules"
9. Try accessing `http://23.22.44.190:3000` again

## Other Possible Issues

If Security Group is correct, check:

1. **Server running?**
   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@23.22.44.190
   pm2 status
   ```

2. **Server binding correctly?**
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 3000
   # Should show: 0.0.0.0:3000
   ```

3. **Using correct URL?**
   - ✅ `http://23.22.44.190:3000` (HTTP)
   - ❌ `https://23.22.44.190:3000` (HTTPS - no SSL configured)

## Testing

Once fixed, you should be able to:

1. Access `http://23.22.44.190:3000` in browser
2. See the Hangman landing page
3. Create/join lobbies
4. Play the game

Test health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://23.22.44.190:3000/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","uptime":123.45}
```

## Need More Help?

1. Read [AWS_QUICK_FIX.md](./AWS_QUICK_FIX.md) first
2. If still stuck, read [AWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./AWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. Follow the diagnostic checklist step by step
4. The issue is in your AWS setup, not the code

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- [ ] Did I open port 3000 in the Security Group?
- [ ] Did I add BOTH 0.0.0.0/0 AND ::/0 rules?
- [ ] Is my server actually running? (pm2 status)
- [ ] Am I using HTTP not HTTPS?
- [ ] Am I using the correct EC2 public IP?
